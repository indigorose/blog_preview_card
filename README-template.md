## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I wanted to start up my Frontend Mentor challenges again and completed this within a day when the challenge launched. As it was the Christmas break, I am uploading now for completion and hope to do many more challenges this year than before.

### Continued development

This challenge required very basic HTML and CSS and for this challenge I wanted to see what I remembered from CSS styling. Going forward I would like to build on my flexbox skills.
